# SnapSmack Architecture Conventions

## Version & Headers

Current version: **Alpha v0.7.9c "Electric Chair"**. Every PHP file opens with a standardised doc-block:

```php
<?php
/**
 * SNAPSMACK - [Module Name]
 * Alpha v0.7.9c
 *
 * [Description of what this file does.]
 */
```

Follow the existing header and commenting style exactly. Do not invent new formats.

## Absolute Rules

1. **No inline `<script>` blocks.** All JavaScript lives in `/assets/js/`. Engine scripts follow the naming convention `ss-engine-{name}.js`. Skins declare which scripts they need via `require_scripts[]` in their manifest. The only exception is the existing `<style>` blocks in `skin-header.php` for conditional CSS overrides (bevel, wood grain, square crop) that require PHP logic.

2. **No inline `<style>` blocks for new CSS.** All skin styling goes in the skin's own `style.css`. Dynamic overrides (colours, fonts, sizes, textures) are compiled into the `custom_css_public` blob by `smack-skin.php` at save time. Use the manifest's `selector`/`property` system or `custom-`/`css` block pattern — never inject CSS from PHP.

3. **Skins never get their own JS or fonts.** They check out what they need from the CMS via their `manifest.php`. Available resources are declared in `core/manifest-inventory.php`.

## Directory Structure

```
/assets/css/          — Global and engine CSS (ss-engine-*.css, public-facing.css)
/assets/js/           — All JavaScript (ss-engine-*.js, formatting-toolbar.js, etc.)
/assets/fonts/        — TTF fonts (all open-use), one folder per family with license copy
/core/                — Shared PHP: auth, meta, sidebar, header, footer, manifest-inventory
/licenses/            — Consolidated licensing (fonts, libraries, SnapSmack itself)
/skins/{skin-name}/   — One directory per skin (HYPHENS only, never underscores)
    manifest.php      — Declares options, features, required scripts, fonts
    style.css         — All skin CSS (defaults via :root variables)
    skin-header.php   — PHP conditional CSS overrides + header HTML
    skin-footer.php   — Footer HTML
    layout.php        — Single image view template
    landing.php       — Landing page template
    archive-layout.php
    skin-meta.php
    help.php
    assets/           — Skin-specific images (wall textures, etc.)
/migrations/          — SQL migration files
```

## Manifest System

- `core/manifest-inventory.php` is the **single source of truth** for available fonts, Google Fonts, and JS engines.
- Skin `manifest.php` presents what the skin uses back to the CMS.
- Options with `selector`/`property` generate CSS automatically at save time.
- Options with `'property' => 'custom-*'` use the `'css'` key on each select option to emit full CSS blocks.
- Options with no `selector`/`property` are saved to DB but handled by PHP (e.g. bevel style, wood grain).
- Font options should merge local fonts: `foreach ($inventory['local_fonts'] ?? [] as $_k => $_f) $fonts[$_k] = $_f['label'];`
- Exception: skins using `allowed_fonts` (like impact-printer) deliberately restrict the font list.

## Database Conventions

- All skin settings use the `htbs_` prefix (shared between Galleria and Hip to be Square).
- Settings stored in `snap_settings` as key-value pairs.
- `INSERT IGNORE` for initial seeding; `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` for saves.
- Changing a skin's defaults in the manifest does NOT require a migration — the manifest `default` is used as fallback when no DB value exists.

## CSS Architecture

- `style.css` provides defaults via `:root` custom properties.
- The compiled CSS blob (`custom_css_public`) loads AFTER `style.css` and overrides defaults.
- Load order in `core/meta.php`: public-facing.css → @font-face → style.css → dynamic compiled CSS.
- Wall textures use the `custom-wall-texture` property pattern with per-option `css` blocks.
- Wall background colour targets `--wall-bg` CSS variable on `:root`.

## Design Decisions

- Do not ask for design decisions. Just make them. The answer is yes.
- Proxy blocks `git push` from the Cowork VM — user pushes from their local machine.
- `database/schema/snapsmack_canonical.sql` is maintained here and committed with every schema change. Do not ask the user to update it.
- Git workflow: Claude stages and commits. User pushes.

## Skin Status Values

- `stable` — Production ready (Galleria, Hip to be Square)
- `beta` — Functional but not fully tested (Rational Geo)
- `development` — Work in progress, not installable from gallery (Kiosk)
